# Single Layer Neural Network
 
This is a simple implementation of a single layer neural network with logistic regression. In this simplified network, the single layer perceptron (for classification) is effectively a logistic regression.

## How to use

1. Install the required libraries by running in your terminal `pip install -r requirements.txt`
2. Run `python3 breast_cancer.py` to train and test the model using the Wisconsin Breast Cancer dataset from sci-kit learm
